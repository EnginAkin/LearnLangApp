You were nicknamed Herostratus because you burned a hole in a schoolbook with a cigarette, and I was nicknamed Ephialtes because I was fond of telling tales. Ho--ho! . . . we were children! . . . Don't be shy, Nafanya. Go nearer to him. And this is my wife, her maiden name was Vantsenbach, of the Lutheran persuasion. . . .\"" +

            "Nafanail thought a little and took refuge behind his father's back." +

            "\"Well, how are you doing my friend?\" the fat man asked, looking enthusiastically at his friend. \"Are you in the service? What grade have you reached?\"" +

            "\"I am, dear boy! I have been a collegiate assessor for the last two years and I have the Stanislav. The salary is poor, but that's no great matter! The wife gives music lessons, and I go in for carving wooden cigarette cases in a private way. Capital cigarette cases! I sell them for a rouble each. If any one takes ten or more I make a reduction of course. We get along somehow. I served as a clerk, you know, and now I have been transferred here as a head clerk in the same department. I am going to serve here. And what about you? I bet you are a civil councillor by now? Eh?\"\n" +

            "\"No dear boy, go higher than that,\" said the fat man. \"I have risen to privy councillor already . . . I have two stars.\"" +

            "The thin man turned pale and rigid all at once, but soon his face twisted in all directions in the broadest smile; it seemed as though sparks were flashing from his face and eyes. He squirmed, he doubled together, crumpled up. . . . His portmanteaus, bundles and cardboard boxes seemed to shrink and crumple up too. . . . His wife's long chin grew longer still; Nafanail drew himself up to attention and fastened all the buttons of his uniform." +

            "\"Your Excellency, I . . . delighted! The friend, one may say, of childhood and to have turned into such a great man! He--he!\"")
